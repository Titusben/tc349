Site critique etsy.com

The site itself is very bland the only color being the blue links and Etsy homepage navigator. 
Where they get most of the color is through items that are for sale. From a marketing standpoint 
this is great. It makes one scan what is for sale rather than busy one’s self learning the website 
operation. The site reminds me a lot of amazon.com. The links to categories are right oriented and 
the search bar is on the top, using most of the space for goods. There is a lot of white space which 
makes the items stick out as much as they do. If the items were not so fantastic and unique the site 
may have difficulties. 

The color palate was explained above, white and dark orange being the principle color of the Etsy home 
button. The arrangement is in neat and ordered rows and columns which are expected. However, I think that 
this site is a little basic. The site itself is very dull in comparison to the products on sale. This isn’t 
a bad thing but with all the wondrous things that the site peddles one would think that its design might be 
a little more interesting and unique.
