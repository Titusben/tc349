<h1> Critque of <a href="http://panic.com/" >panic.com.</a></h1>
<h2>
<p>
    Panic.com uses a style that is more organic that normal websites. The website has a minimalist 
	feel to it. It uses large colorful buttons with tooltips to direct you to the main product pages of 
	each individual app. From there the site uses two columns or rows but keeps the amount of text down 
	as much as possible. All the pictures double as links to help navigation.  However, the descriptions 
	of each are somewhat vague due to the, few words as possible, mentality. It also incorporates the use 
	of animations on the buttons and pictures and uses very large font which could be somewhat distracting.
</P>
<p> 
	The bright colors and graphics are pleasing to the eye and grabs hold of the users attention. It does 
	not diverge from its theme at any point while navigating the site. One of the sites strongest aspects 
	is that it feels progressive. Its not just some links texts and pictures its something more interactive 
	which can be very pleasing to customers in the demographic they are targeting.  However, because of this 
	it also has a bit of convolution and temper that some may find a little childish or immature. The lack of 
	information also lends to the feeling that the company is hiding something. I think that observation is a 
	rather rare and particular one. Overall its a nice website that is well planned and is effective.
