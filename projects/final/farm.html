			<h3>Mission</h3>
			<p>Springhill vineyard is dedicated to DIY winemakers. We sell by the pound to those you wish 
			to make their own red and white table wines. Our grapes are cared for using organic and integrated 
			pest management to bring the customer the freshest and most beautiful fruit.<p>
			<h3>Services</h3>
			<p>We have a crusher/destemer and will crush them for you at the time of your purchase. We have a 
			press and for a small additional fee you can have your whites pressed immediately after the crushing.
			</p>
			<h3>Preorders</h3>
			<p>We accept preorders starting in the early part of the spring. (See grape selections)
			Price is determined by the market and the growing season. In the past we have sold them 
			for $1pound.To preorder just send us an email with your contact information and what types 
			of grapes you would like and how many pounds you are looking for. We will reply as soon as 
			possible with information concerning your preorder. No deposit is necessary at the time of 
			the preorder.
			</p>
			<h3>Pick up and delivery</h3>
			<p>We will let you know when your grape variety is getting close to harvest so that you can get your
			equipment together. You need to provide your own bins or buckets to transport crushed or pressed grapes. 
			Then several days ahead of harvest we will let you know when to show up for your order. (see map) By the 
			way, all our grapes are picked by hand by volunteers so anytime you can lend a hand let us know and we’ll 
			get to know you better. Thanks.
			</p>
			<h3>Harvest Party</h3>
			<p>In late October,  All winemaker customers are invited back for snacks, music, and sampling of each others 
			wine. This is a private party limited to 21 and over. And it’s excellent fun!
