	This is what I came up with so far. As I continue to explore the world of codding and web development 
I may make changes depending on how I feel or even what type of project I am working on. Right now I am using
notepad+++ for my text editor. It seems rather bare boned at the moment but I feel if I am going to learn html
language it will be better for me if I type everything out instead of have the text editor do half of it for me. 
I have used Dreamweaver before but none of it really stuck with me. 
	So my set up is I have the text editor in the top left, and the webpage I am working on the right side
of the screen. I also have git and its file location on the bottom left and that my change for more space with 
the text editor when needed. For whatever reason, I like the text editor, long and on the left or at the top, 
opposed to being on the bottom of the screen. I suppose we will see how much I like this setup.
