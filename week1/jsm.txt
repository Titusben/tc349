	Jasonsatamaria.com is an interesting website. As a critique I will start with the format. 
Two columns, left side text and the right pictures or text, lend well to the chronological style 
of the site. There is a lot of white space and the font helps with that but at the same time it 
feels a little small. On my machine that has a high native resolution the entire website fits on 
one half of the screen and the rest is filed in with white space. But, overall the main page is 
effective and it’s well organized. The black bar at the bottom is good contrast, as it incorporates 
a different font that lends well to the black and white theme. 
	On a personal level I like the two column approach and the white space does give the impression that 
nothing is being squished. The picture being much larger than the text also helps with this. I also like the 
color palette of red, black and white. It’s very clear and concise. However the only thing I don’t really like 
is that it feels a little sterile, probably due to the white space. But for a lot of the subject matter that tends 
to be in the creative realm it seems stunted. I think a little graphic art would go a long way. Things like the
Jason Santa Maria, what I will assume is a symbol, at the top would add more to the page if it was larger 
and other graphical elements would also lend to a better atmosphere. But the content is excellent and 
appropriate for the style and overall it’s a very effective website.
