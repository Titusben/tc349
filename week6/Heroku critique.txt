Heroku Critique

Heroku is an interesting website. Let’s start with color. Heroku uses a dark purple, gray and black palette, 
but there is more. Beyond that intriguing color design small splashes of color also make its appearance 
drawing the eye around the website where the creator wishes one to look. Another aspect of its color 
design is when the cursor is over an interactive object interesting things happen.  This could mean 
filling in lifelike color that gives more intensity to the object that differs from the normal color scheme 
or it highlights the object in unique ways. Heroku uses color very well in there site. 

The format of the page is simple but highly effective. Heroku uses a common top down approach while usually 
sticking to the two column systems. But beyond that are the animations that Heroku has incorporated as well 
as very helpful and easy to see menus and buttons. They also use an advertising approach to some of their more 
interesting buttons.  They say things like observe, command, and relax opposed to more traditional assertions. 
This may lead to some confusion but it’s enjoyable to explore the site and engage with it longer then would 
one would normally. 

Overall Heroku is an interesting and engaging site and is very effective and advanced. I enjoyed it very much.
