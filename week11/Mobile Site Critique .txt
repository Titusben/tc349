MSUFCU Mobile Site Critique by Benjamin Titus

MSU federal credit union’s mobile site starts with the main page. Dead center of the page is the 
login/password fields so one can access their accounts. This is smart because for most people 
that’s the main reason for using the site. The layout continues by scrolling down and they have a 
series of tabs that take you to another page. The first one is locations followed by rates, contact 
us and more. These are in a logical order of importance when looking at the use of the site on a 
mobile device. Clicking on one of them takes you to a different page where the information is 
readily displayed or if more information is required more horizontal buttons are displayed.  This 
is an ok way of doing things but it’s very bland and the information is rather sparse. It contains 
very little information beyond that of the bare minimum. 

The site is well laid out and does follow standard color schemes of MSU, white and green, which 
just so happens to complement each other and make for a very easy reading atmosphere. 
However, there is very little content on the site. There isn’t any interesting graphics and the 
whole site is devoid of any kind of picture. But overall the site is effective and loads fast. It’s 
interesting how different it is from the app however. It seems logical they could have followed a 
similar approach. Overall its effective but very sterile.
