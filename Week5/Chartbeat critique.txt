	Chartbeat is an interesting site. Its formated in a single column and then Using diffrent colors 
form rows of its content. To start with its color it uses a wide varitey of intresting color and the texture 
the site uses gives it a very pastel feel wich is visually very pleasing to the eye. It also lends to the 
credability of there product as they use the words revolutionalry and prograessive in there speach about it, 
thus there product is aplified by the look and feel of the website. Many animations are also part of the site 
which gives it a new a fresh feel, like it was just created and at the forfront of modern webdesign. 
	Chartbeat does not have a very traditional design. It is section in rows and the user must scroll down
to access the content. However these rows are divided into cells using the sites own design elemnets making it 
easy to read and understand. It also has very little content in the form of words and a lot of content in graphics. 
It gives an interactive feel without actually being interactive. What is most intresting is the webpage updates in 
real time apposed to having to refresh which also pushes the product because it shows how proficient the developers
are. Overall this is a very effective website and is the most engaging I have seen so far.
