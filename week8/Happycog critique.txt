Happycog.com uses a style that I have seen a lot of lately. It’s a style that is different from the norm. Instead of having multiple pages, the site uses one scroll able page that has much of the content. Then that page is sectioned off to denote the different content types. Happy cog uses a lot of whitespace to isolate as well as making the different content stick out. It also uses mouse over animations and effects on some of the content. This style mixes up the overall esthetic of the site. This has its advantages because the style changes as the content which increases engagement because of the wide verity of experiences. Another benefit is if a particular color or style is not liked by the user all one has to do is scroll a little and you’re at a completely different area. 	

One of the more interesting affects is one clicks on one of the links at the top, the page does a scroll animation that gives the look that the content is coming up to meet you. This page is highly effective at what it does. It manages deliver content very easily and intuitively. The multitude of colors and fonts also increases usability as well as engagement.
