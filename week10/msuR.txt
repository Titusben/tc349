	The MSU mobile uses a very simple esthetic. For the mobile site icons were chosen over links and 
cluttering text. This is an excellent move for several reasons. Most notably one can identify the icon they 
wish to select before reading its description. This allows for quicker and easier access. But, the greatest 
advantage this has is that people won’t “fat finger” the links and go off to someplace they don’t want to go.
It has a very simple yet elegant design at the homepage, being very minimalist. It is designed more like an 
app then a website and that’s not a bad thing at all. The color scheme follows the traditional colors of the 
university and is very effective at showcasing the buttons. It was a good decision to use a gray instead of 
flat white. 
	On the other pages of the site the content is pushed in a standard row like format which is good for 
mobile devices. The categories chosen are very helpful in describing where to go and what you can do there. 
If one is looking for something on the MSU site using the mobile site would be much faster and simpler. This 
is a great credit to designer because that’s what most people need when looking on a mobile site. The only 
problem I have with the site is that it’s relatively subdued and devoid of creative styles and colors. The 
simplicity is good but it doesn’t look like it took very long to make. It just seems like it should contain 
a bit more style to match its substance.
