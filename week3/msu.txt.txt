	Michigan State Universty's homepage change dramatically recently. The new site is much better
then the old one. Starting with the arangement from the top down the website displayes, in large semi-block
letters, "Michigan State University."There is no doubt were you are after first comming to the page. 
THe site has a search box in the classic style being at the top right. Just below the headings the site 
has various tabs in which to navigate. Just below that is a slide show that showcases a few of the things 
that MSU you students maybe doing or projects that is being worked on. from there it goes on with some news 
and misc. things. Most notably it uses a row formate on the main page that is not part of the site once one 
navigates some where else. 
	The color of the MSU site is very simple. It follows the colors of msu, green and white and veraitions
of them, which is in itself a plesent color scheme and is very effective for the site. Another thing to note
is the initial font and style of the "Michigan State University" header remains throught the website and 
is a good reacuring style. Over all the new website is very effective, however one major difficulty I have 
with it is that no one is really intersted in anything that is on the main site, other then the casual surfer.
The tabs of the top are the first things clicked so there content should be showcased more then messing around 
with all the drop down, scrolling set up, that currently is implemented.
