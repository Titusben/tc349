      Vimeo is a video upload site whose content is all users generated. It’s similar to 
YouTube. However, where YouTube is a site specifically for sharing with larger audience 
Vimeo is more for uploading and linking friends to videos. Evidence to this affect is apparent 
when Vimeo requires one to log in before entering the main content area of the site. This is why 
they put the log in right in the center of the screen instead of to the top right. But, to critique 
Vimeo is the assignment. So, Vimeo’s main page is a classic single column design with variable 
changes along the way. It changes to a non-fluid multi-column layout half way down and then 
back again to a single column layout. It also has a series of non-tiled background that showcase 
the different types of content within the site. 
	How effective is it? Well the color scheme is pleasing and the background is very well 
done. But, I find that I am doing an awful lot of scrolling particularly when you click on a link 
and change your mind and go back to the main page I have to scroll a bunch to get to different 
content. One interesting effect that I think adds a nice web 2.0 feel is that the conent shifts down 
when you hover over drop down tabs at the top of the screen, this mixed with the animations in 
the background gives it a nice feel. But, by looking at those things alone it would be difficult to 
discern the purpose of the site. Perhaps it would be more intuitive to have content in the 
background that represents the sites content better. So, Vimeo is effective but it definitely could 
use a little refinement.
