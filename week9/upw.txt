United Pixel Workers Critique

	My first impression of unitedpixelworkers.com was wow this stuff is big. The icons are large and right in your face as you first enter the site. The text and symbols are all very large. The liberal use of whitespace also increases the feeling of size you get when entering the site. The site design is very minimalist. There is not much text, but instead it uses large icons and pictures to move your eyes across the screen. It gives the feeling that the people that go here do it for a reason and they know what they want. The color scheme is equally pleasing. It uses blues and orange which are excellent colors to use to highlight certain things. The content itself is very specialized and targets a particular audience. Not many people would understand some of the jokes or shirts. But those that do would feel welcome. 
	One of the most interesting things about this site is that it uses basic animations to move content throughout the screen based on the size of the page. On my computer half width shows the top two highlighted clothing items. But when I go full screen it fills in the right side with the things that I normally would have to scroll down for. In doing this it uses a delayed animation that gives the site some character. Overall I would say this site is very well made and is effective at its presentation and content delivery.
